## Introduction
### Well Rounded Software Engineers
In order to become an exceptional software engineer, you need to excel in the following four areas: capable, creative, collaborative, curious. 
Capable entails knowing the technology and being able to use it well.
_Creative_ means making things that are usable, efficient, and maintainable. Knowing how to organize and sculpt code is incredibly creative.
__Collaborative__ is important because an application is generally built by a team, and having social skills will greatly determine your success
__Curious__ means to accept more than just a job, but looking into why the job is important and useful, searching for alternative directions, and digging into the inner workings of a black box.

### Christlike Learning
An overarching quality that is important is Christlike, which includes having gratitude, focusing on divine inspiration, and having an eternal perspective.
### Making Mistakes
Making mistakes is a key component for learning. Recognize and embrace the power of making mistakes. Many important discoveries have come out of making mistakes, and it will be helpful to make mistakes in a good way--make notes, have peers, and make sure you can replicate your mistakes. Approach new things with the expectation of making mistakes.
### Welcome to ‘Startup 260’
This class has the energy of a startup - build applications to change the world, have no funding, work long hours.

## Why Am I Here?
Consider two questions: What do I want? What am I willing to do?
### Motivation: What do I want?
There are many different levels of motivation. They include:
__Unfocused__: I need to do something. It might as well be this.
__Badge__: I need credits towards graduation or getting a job.
__Exploration__: I am curious about this
__Mastery__: I want this as one of my core abilities
__Leader__: I want to be a leader in this space.

### Investment: What am I willing to do?
Motivation determines your level of investment and what you will get out of it. For each level of motivation, there is a spectrum of possible investment.

### Enjoy the Journey
The destination is a byproduct of the journey and what you’ve learned along the way. If the journey feels overwhelming, remember your motivation and your progress. Focus one step at a time.

### Deliverable
I want to immeribly lead; I wish to complete 125% of deliverables, study all instruction, actively participate in class, engage beyond instruction, creatively explore new directions, be driven by curiosity to explore, collaborate with others, and seek inspiration and eternal application.

## GitHub
### readme.md
This class will require taking notes using the README.md file as well as using the notes.md file. The notes.md file will be usable on the midterm and final.
### Forks
A fork allows you to create a copy of a repository. One forks a repository in order to experiment with or contribute to a open source code base. 
### Creating a History of your work
Much of this course will revolve around the startup github repository, created later in this assignment. This is used for backup, portfolio, proof of work, exploration, and experience. This requires students to commit often--students should make a small stable change and then commit.
