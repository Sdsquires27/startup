### CodePen
CodePen is an important application which will immediately render written code in a preview window, which will allow you to make small changes and see the results immediately. When working with assignments, do the following:
1. Either create  new pen or fork an existing one
2. Conduct the experiment as defined by the assignment
3. Save your assignment periodically
4. Submit the pen’s URL in Canvas together with a description of something you learned. 

### HTML introduction
HTML provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build on. HTML was originally designed to be a publishing format for web documents, or pages. Now, we use web applications, which are either single paged or multi-paged. To make an application, we will need to use CSS as well as JavaScript, but we will start with HTML.
#### Elements and Tags
HTML elements are represented with enclosing tags that may enclose other elements or text. For example, to make a paragraph, you tag it with (p) to show that it is a structural paragraph of text. Tags are delimited using <> and closing tags will have a / before its name:

<p>Hello world</p>

We can continue adding structures to the page with additional elements, each of which may contain other elements to create an overall structure. The <html> element is the top level page structure, and <head> contains metadata about the page and title. <body> is content structure and <main> is main content structure (as part of the <body>). Even if we were to write a lot:
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

It would still render the same, since it’s almost entirely about structure. The visual appearance won’t change until we start to use CSS.

#### Attributes
Each element may have attributes, which describe specific details of the element. id, for instance, gives a unique id to the element in order to distinguish it. ‘class’ designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. They are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value:
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>

#### Hyperlinks
One of the most essential aspects of the web is the ability to create a hyperlink to take you from one page to another with a simple click. This is represented by the anchor (a) element with an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (href). For instance:
<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>

#### Complete example
HTML defines a header (<!DOCTYPE html>) that tells the browser the type and version of the document, which should always be included at the top of the HTML file.

Character

&amp;
<
&lt;
>

"
&quot;
'

#### HTML Versions
Understanding when different HTML features were introduced helps you know what has been around.  Newer features might not be as stable. Here are some key features:
HTML1, 1990, format tags
HTML2, 1995, tables and internationalization
HTML3, 1997, MathML, CSS, frame tags
HTML4, 1999, external CSS
HTML5, 2014, email, password, media, semantic tags

#### index.html
By default, a web server will display the HTML file named index.html when a web browser makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application index.html
#### Rendering HTML
You can save any HTML file to your computer’s disk and then open the file using your browser. You can also open the file in VS Code and use the Live Server extension to display the HTML. CodePen is also a sandbox that will allow you to easily play with HTML.
