# Unit 0 Notes
CS 260
## Introduction
### Well Rounded Software Engineers
In order to become an exceptional software engineer, you need to excel in the following four areas: capable, creative, collaborative, curious. 
Capable entails knowing the technology and being able to use it well.
_Creative_ means making things that are usable, efficient, and maintainable. Knowing how to organize and sculpt code is incredibly creative.
__Collaborative__ is important because an application is generally built by a team, and having social skills will greatly determine your success
__Curious__ means to accept more than just a job, but looking into why the job is important and useful, searching for alternative directions, and digging into the inner workings of a black box.

### Christlike Learning
An overarching quality that is important is Christlike, which includes having gratitude, focusing on divine inspiration, and having an eternal perspective.
### Making Mistakes
Making mistakes is a key component for learning. Recognize and embrace the power of making mistakes. Many important discoveries have come out of making mistakes, and it will be helpful to make mistakes in a good way--make notes, have peers, and make sure you can replicate your mistakes. Approach new things with the expectation of making mistakes.
### Welcome to ‘Startup 260’
This class has the energy of a startup - build applications to change the world, have no funding, work long hours.

## Why Am I Here?
Consider two questions: What do I want? What am I willing to do?
### Motivation: What do I want?
There are many different levels of motivation. They include:
__Unfocused__: I need to do something. It might as well be this.
__Badge__: I need credits towards graduation or getting a job.
__Exploration__: I am curious about this
__Mastery__: I want this as one of my core abilities
__Leader__: I want to be a leader in this space.

### Investment: What am I willing to do?
Motivation determines your level of investment and what you will get out of it. For each level of motivation, there is a spectrum of possible investment.

### Enjoy the Journey
The destination is a byproduct of the journey and what you’ve learned along the way. If the journey feels overwhelming, remember your motivation and your progress. Focus one step at a time.

### Deliverable
I want to immeribly lead; I wish to complete 125% of deliverables, study all instruction, actively participate in class, engage beyond instruction, creatively explore new directions, be driven by curiosity to explore, collaborate with others, and seek inspiration and eternal application.

## GitHub
### readme.md
This class will require taking notes using the README.md file as well as using the notes.md file. The notes.md file will be usable on the midterm and final.
### Forks
A fork allows you to create a copy of a repository. One forks a repository in order to experiment with or contribute to a open source code base. 
### Creating a History of your work
Much of this course will revolve around the startup github repository, created later in this assignment. This is used for backup, portfolio, proof of work, exploration, and experience. This requires students to commit often--students should make a small stable change and then commit. 

## Asking Questions

### How to ask questions
Before asking any question, make sure you do these things first:
- Have read deliverable specifications thoroughly. Sometimes this means 3 – 4 times.
- Work at solving the problem on your own for at least 30 minutes.
- Use unit tests to help you debug your problems.
- Read the course instructional content before asking questions.
- Try consulting the API documentation first.
- Debug your code using the IDE.
- Write, run, and be able to justify the effectiveness of your own test cases.
- Attend every class.
- Have a well-formed question to ask the TA.
- Put yourself in a frame of mind to accept new ideas.
Remember one purpose of this class is for you to learn how to learn. If the TA feels you are not putting forth your full, they may ask you to return later when you have fulfilled these requirements.
Pay forward any help you get.

## The Console
This is the command line, a simple in-out console that allows one to type commands to receive responses.

### Viewing the File System
You can see where you currently are using the pwd command. You can see all the files within the current directory using the ls command. 

### Executing Commands
Other commands include:
- echo - Output the parameters of the command
- cd - Change directory
- mkdir - Make directory
- rmdir - Remove directory
- rm - Remove file(s)
- mv - Move file(s)
- cp - Copy files
- ls - List files
- curl - Command line client URL browser
- grep - Regular expression search
- find - Find files
- top - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- df - View disk statistics
- cat - Output the contents of a file
- less - Interactively output the contents of a file
- wc - Count the words in a file
- ps - View the currently running processes
- kill - Kill a currently running process
- sudo - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- ssh - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- scp - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- history - Show the history of commands
- ping - Check if a website is up
- tracert - Trace the connections to a website
- dig - Show the DNS information for a domain
- man - Look up a command in the manual
You can also do specific things with the input or output using these special characters:
- | - Take the output from the command on the left and pipe, or pass, it to the command on the right
- /> - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
- />> - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists

## History of the Web
The history of the web can be defined in three general phases:
1. The formation of the internet that supports the communication of web applications
2. The creation of HTML and HTTP that made it possible to shared hyperlinked documents (Web 1.0).
3. The creation of CSS and JavaScript that enabled interactive web applications (Web 2.0).
### The Internet
The first step into web programming was the creation of a global communications network that was public and reliable. ARPANET was created by the US government as a means of sharing information between universities in order to withstand nuclear attack. Two computers created a path between each other through a single authority. 
In the 1980s, development was made in this system, creating the internet, which had major expansions in the 1990s and the 2000s. 

### Hypertext Markup Language
Tim Berners-Lee was assigned to create a system that would allow researchers to share documents between remote academic institutions. He created the underpinnings of what became known as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which was revolutionary in part due to its use of hyperlinks, which would allow one to reference another page within it. 
HTTP and URL
Berners-Lee also invented HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which define how web documents are addressed and transmitted across the web.

### Cascading Style Sheets
CSS was proposed as a way to provide styling apart from the browsers reading HTML files, and this has since become the standard, with additional development. 

### JavaScript
JavaScript changed the static web page into a dynamic one, based on a user’s interaction with the page.
